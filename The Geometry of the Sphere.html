Putting mathematics onto a web page still presents a significant
challenge.  Much of the effort in making the following pages as nice
as they are is due to <a href="http://math.rice.edu/~ddonovan">Dennis
Donovan</a>.  <a href="http://math.rice.edu/~hemphill">Boyd
Hemphill</a> added two nice appendices.  Susan Boone
helped construct the Table of Contents.  All of them are
teachers and members of the <a href="http://math.rice.edu/~pcmi">Rice
University Site</a> of the <a

We are interested here in the geometry of an ordinary sphere.  In
plane geometry we study points, lines, triangles, polygons, etc.  On
the sphere we have points, but there are no straight lines --- at
least not in the usual sense.  However, straight
lines in the plane are characterized by the fact that they are the
shortest paths between points.  The curves on the sphere with the same
property are the great circles.  Therefore it is natural to use great
circles as replacements for lines.  
Then we can talk about triangles and polygons and other geometrical
objects.  In these notes we will do this, and at the same time we will
continuously 
look back to the plane to compare the spherical results with the
planar results.

<p>We will study the incidence relations between great circles, the
notion of angle on the sphere, and the areas of
certain fundamental regions on the sphere, culminating with the area
of spherical triangles.
Our ultimate goal is  two very nice results.  First we will
prove Girard's Theorem, which gives a formula for the sum of the
angles in a spherical triangle.  Then we will use Girard's Theorem to
prove Euler's Theorem that says that in any convex, three dimensional
polyhedron we have <strong><var>V&nbsp;-&nbsp;E&nbsp;+&nbsp;F&nbsp;=&nbsp; 2</var></strong>, where
<strong><var>V</var></strong> <img src="space.gif" width=5> is the
number of vertices, <strong><var>E</var></strong> <img src="space.gif"
width=5> is the number of edges, and <strong><var>F</var></strong>
<img src="space.gif" width=5> is the number of faces.  <p><hr>
